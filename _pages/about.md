I am a biostatistician and currently an assistant professor in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. My CWRU profile can be found <a href='https://case.edu/medicine/pqhs/node/2421'>here</a>. My work has an overarching theme of data-driven precision medicine for cancer. It spans a wide spectrum of applied statistics: clinical trial design and analysis, prediction model development and assessment, meta-analysis, causal inference, etc.

During my Ph.D. study at the University of Michigan, I worked on missing data problems and dynamic treatment regimes under the supervision of Professor <a href='https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/wang-lu.html'>Lu Wang</a>. Before grad school, I got a Bachelor's degree in analytical chemistry from Peking University, China. 

A coffee lover, especially light roasts. And espresso beans covered by dark chocolate, or not. Coffee before or after morning <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/'>HIIT</a>? That is the question.
